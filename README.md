# CrossBorderX
CrossBorderX is a blockchain-based remittance prototype that enables instant global money transfers using stablecoins and LP. It converts local currency into crypto (like USDT), transfers it across border within seconds, and swaps it back into the destination currency, reducing fees, delays, and intermediaries found in traditional banking systems.
