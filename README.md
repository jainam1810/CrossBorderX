# 🌍 CrossBorderX – Instant Global FX Transfers Using Crypto Rails (Walletless)

> **Transfer any currency across borders within seconds using stablecoins and blockchain liquidity pools.**

## 🚀 Overview

**CrossBorderX** is a prototype for instant, low-cost, cross-border money transfers built on blockchain.  
Instead of relying on traditional SWIFT banking rails, this project uses **stablecoins (e.g., USDT/USDC)** and **decentralized liquidity pools** to move value globally in seconds.

Example flow:
> A user in Mumbai sends ₹10,000 INR to a friend in London → the amount is converted into USDT → transferred via blockchain → swapped into GBP using a liquidity pool → instantly available in the receiver’s wallet.

This project demonstrates how **crypto rails can replace outdated banking networks** to achieve instant remittance with minimal fees.

## 🧩 Features

✅ **Instant Transfers** – Send any amount across borders using stablecoins within seconds.  
✅ **Low Fees** – Avoid intermediary bank and forex conversion fees - ~0.1%–0.3% backend fees (liquidity, gas, swap). 
✅ **Walletless UX** - user doesn’t hold crypto, no MetaMask, no private keys  
✅ **Transparent & Auditable** – Every transaction is visible on the blockchain.  
✅ **Compliance-Ready** – Includes a KYC placeholder for future AML/KYC integration, fiat on/off-ramp checks.  
✅ **Built for FinTech Innovation** – A proof-of-concept for next-generation remittance startups.

## 🔄 How the Transfer Works (Walletless Flow)

1️⃣ **User Initiates Transfer** - User enters INR → GBP and pays via UPI/Bank Transfer.
2️⃣ **Backend Custody (No Wallet for User)** - Backend stores INR in a custodial balance under their verified profile.
3️⃣ **Convert INR → USDT (Backend Only)** - Backend mints/purchases USDT via exchange or OTC partner.
4️⃣ **Blockchain Settlement** - USDT sent instantly on a high-speed chain (Polygon/Base/Solana).
5️⃣ **Liquidity Pool Swap** - USDT → GBP-stablecoin using low-slippage LP.
6️⃣ **Off-Ramp to UK Bank** - GBP → UK bank via Faster Payments System (FPS). (USER CHOICE) - ⏱️ Usually minutes depending on bank.
7️⃣ **Receiver gets GBP in Bank** - Receiver never interacts with crypto.

| Component               | Cost (Approx)     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Blockchain gas fees     | $0.01 – $0.05     |
| DEX swap fee            | 0.05% – 0.30%     |
| Off-ramp withdrawal fee | ~£1 – £2          |
| Compliance/KYC cost     | negligible per tx |

### ⭐ Total Backend Cost: 0.1% – 0.3% 
This is much lower than traditional payment rails.
